#First Class - September 6th, 2013
###Instructor - Faisal M. Khan

This class was a brief overview of our upcoming semester.  Prof. Khan spoke about how this was going to be a class of structure and discovery regarding the fundamentals of Analytics without getting bogged down in the details of heavy programming and algorithms.  
Some notes I collected during the class for further investigation:
>- [Aboutthedata.com](https://aboutthedata.com/) - Interest site of all your information!
- [Gleason Grade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason_Grading_System "Gleason Grade") - 
- Discordant Data - Data that is not of one accord: conflicting

We are going to be using the [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) toolkit. The text book is also written by the leading developers of this project.
